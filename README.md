# SentimentAnalysisofNewspapers

Abstractâ€”Violence in the media is becoming more prolific than ever. Violent content in news articles is detrimental to the
psychological growth of minors and is not appropriate for their consumption. With the availability of online material, minors
have access to violent materials like never before.

In this paper, we build and test the capabilities of three Naive Bayes classifiers, Linear SVM classifier, decision trees, random
forests, adaboost with logistic regression, and extra tree classifier to perform sentiment analysis to determine which articles are
appropriate and inappropriate for minors.We work with a subset of the data from the GDELT project, which performs analysis on news articles to determine the events and actions taking place in
the article. GDELT breaks the articles into the 20 CAMEO codes, and further into verbal cooperation and conflict and material
cooperation and conflict that we use for classifying whether or not something is appropriate or inappropriate.
